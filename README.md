# Critical Path Method

## The critical path method, or critical path analysis, is an algorithm for scheduling a set of project activities. It is commonly used in conjunction with the program evaluation and review technique.

This is a python program that

- takes an activity table with each activity's predecessors and duration and stores it into a graph
- using a modified Breadth First Search algorithm to traverse the graph and determine the correct path
- calculates number of attributes for each activity following the selected path, these attributes are :
  - DU = Activity Duration
  - ES = Early Start Time
  - EF = Early Finish Time
  - LS = Late Start Time
  - LF = Late Finish Time
  - SK = Slack Value
- draws a plot showing the the graph, attributes for each node and critical path (green nodes),

## Here is Some Sample Tests And It's Output

| Activity | Predecessors | Duration |
| -------- | ------------ | -------- |
| A        | -            | 7        |
| B        | A            | 9        |
| C        | A            | 3        |

Used Tools:

- Python -obviously-
- Pandas: to import the data from csv files and store it in adjacency list for the graph
- Networkx: to make the graph, nodes, edges, colors, arrows and everything
- Graphviz: to calculate the positions for the graph nodes by "dot" engine
- Matplotlib: to draw all these stuff
